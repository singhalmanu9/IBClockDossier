This was the project I submitted to the IB for IB Computer Science SL in 2014. It is a program that solves a Rubik's Clock (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Clock) by applying the Pochmann Method.

This project was completed over a period of 3 weeks with significant input from potential users and implements a significant portion of the 15 mastery qualities specified by the IBO, some of which include mutation of arrays, polymorphism, user-defined function with parameters, etc.

BreezyGUI.jar and Writer were not my creation, and I simply used them from other sources in order to acheive the results required from the program. I do not claim any them or any part of them to be of my creation.
